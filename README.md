# Jively
This was a 10 day project to kickstart Boston University's Class of 2019 Senior Design Course. The goal was practice core skills to cooperative engineering such as agile methodology, git code management, and project management. Another goal was to familiarize ourselve with using cloud services, APIs, databases, simulation, and testing. 

## Timeline

On recieving the project, we met to define the system requirements and conceptualize unit tests to ensure the requirements were met. We divided tasks to sprint for first and a second tier of tasks to sprint for after the base design was accomplished. 

Html, javascript, APIs, and databases (pretty much all of this project), was new material for us. After four days of researching and working independently on our tasks, we regrouped to assess our progress. Unfortunately, while we had not accomplished our tasks, due to the learning curve we were still overcoming. We decided to redefine our short term sprint to research a simpler method of accomplishing similar goals to the project definition. After finding our framework in using Flask with MySQL hosted on a AWS instance, we divided tasks again and split to work independently. 

After creating a website with login interface, and a database, we had trouble connecting the database to the flask session. We could fill the database with simulated sensor values, and link them to users, but users recieved the same user ID.

# System Requirements
### 1. Ensuring Security
  - each user gets a unique ID; each ID is associated with that user's sensors.
  - Users can only access their sensors. 
### 2. Building a web app
  - display a plot of sensor data over time with a 5 minute time interval
  - Use cloud service (cloud access)
  - Some database
  - additional features
   - threshhold alerts
   - error checking
  - Multiple users w/ multiple sensors
### 3. Simulate the sensor
  - provides data in degrees C/F
  - remote from the webapp 
  - has error values
